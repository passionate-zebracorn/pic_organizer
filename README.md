# pic_organizer
This is a basic picture organizer written in Python

To use this just grab it and run. You may be missing some dependencies, mainly Pillow. To do this just `pip install pillow` or `python -m pip install pillow`.

For this to work you should have a directory structure like below:

D:\pics

  D:\pics\2009
  
  D:\pics\2010
  
  D:\pics\2011
  
  D:\pics\2012
  
  etc...

Then the base path when asked is D:\pics

This will also write a logfile of what it did to the base path you provide.
